// GAME RULES:
//
// - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
// - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
// - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
// - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
// - The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
//
